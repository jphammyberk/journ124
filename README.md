Looking through all the opinions, this one stood out to me as being both funny and intriguing. Babies on planes are one thing (completely fine), but babies who are brats and scream... that's another thing. Seeing this over social media, I was curious about what people actually think about this. It was unsurprising to me that most people said it is rude/somewhat rude, but what surprised me is that some people said that it wasn't rude. This got me thinking about their reasoning. Maybe some of them have empathy, believing that a baby can't be at fault or that accidents happen, and babies tend to be scared of planes. This has given me a bit of hope for society being more empathetic and understanding, but in my opinion, a solution could be a special soundproof section where parents can take their crying babies. Parents could also give their babies sleeping medicine/melatonin (assuming it is safe) so their baby can sleep the ride off.
